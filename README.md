# Zig-C
This project is being created for a software engineering course. 

We decided, due to the nature of the GIZ project of the project to make a dual platform, both desktop and mobile application. Because the project is divided in regions, the mobile application will be used by the regional coordinators and the desktop application mainly by the central office.

 The work will begin on the desktop version of the application. It will be developed as an application that deals with all the operations of the company, including project submissions, financial statements and on-the-spot control. These files can be accessed only by the project evaluation office and the person who submits them.
 
The mobile version of the application will deal only with on-the-spot control. On-the-spot control includes GPS data to be registered, photo submissions, the completion of a form and additional remarks made by the field commissioner that will register the data. An additional feature that we may add is an internal chat that will connect people of the same project.
